## 12 Month Vision
Activity Stream is more than just a way of finding places on the web you’ve already visited.  It is an extensible platform for intelligently aggregating user activity and for making recommendations on new content.   

Over the next twelve months, Activity Stream will integrate external data sources and provide users with a surface to explore and experience their history in new ways.  We are rewriting the Firefox Library view to give users better access to their history, while at the same time adding new data types such as Videos, Synced Tabs, Screenshots, Pocketed Stories, and Downloads.

We are extending the Pocket integration to make smarter recomendations to users.  

In addition to work on about:home and about:newtab, we are generalizing the Snippets and Onboarding Tour messaging functionality into a centralized Message Center service, that will allow users to view and manage their Firefox notifications.  This system will be extended to be a general service for communication, notifications and messaging with the user.

We will be releasing a Web Extension API that will allow users/developers to add new sections the the Newtab page.  

As always, we remain commited to high performance and high stability.  We are implementing an interface to Sentry to give a better view into 'in the wild' runtime errors.  We are building a process to capture A/B perceived performance videos in order to prevent  perf regressions.  

The team is commited to product improvement through experimentation and data collection.  Each release will be guided and informed by multiple experiments to challenge assumptions and add confidence that we are release the most usable and useful features for our users.
